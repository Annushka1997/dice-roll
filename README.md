Intership With Esterox

*Project Overview:**
In this project, I developed an interactive web-based dice rolling game using JavaScript. The game involves two players, each rolling a pair of dice to determine the outcome. The objective is to create a simple yet engaging experience that showcases the power of web technologies.

**Key Components:**
1. ðŸŽ²User Interface:ðŸŽ² The game features an intuitive user interface with buttons to start the game and display the result. Players can simply click the "Start" button to initiate the dice rolls.
2. ðŸŽ²Dice Animation:ðŸŽ² As the players hit the "Start" button, an appealing dice rolling animation is triggered. The dice on the screen are visually simulated to roll, building suspense and anticipation.
3. ðŸŽ²Randomization:ðŸŽ² The project leverages JavaScript's Math.random() function to generate random numbers between 1 and 6 for each dice, mimicking the roll of physical dice.
4. ðŸŽ²Visual Feedback:ðŸŽ² The rolled numbers are translated into visual feedback through the activation of specific circles on the dice faces. This creates an interactive and dynamic display of the rolled numbers.
5. ðŸŽ²Winning Logic:ðŸŽ² The game determines the winner based on the comparison of the rolled numbers. A message is displayed on the screen indicating whether Player 1, Player 2, or both players have achieved victory.

**Code Snippet Highlights:**
The provided code snippet showcases the core functionalities of the game. It includes event listeners, functions for dice rolling and visualization, as well as the logic for determining the winner.

ðŸš€ This project serves as a great example of how JavaScript and creative UI/UX design can come together to create an engaging web experience.
